# 🌟 Text Emotion Classification Using Grid Search CV

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **text emotion classification**, leveraging **Grid Search CV** for optimizing machine learning models. The goal is to train a classifier that accurately predicts emotions expressed in text.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Advanced Text Processing** – Tokenization, stopword removal, and feature extraction using **TF-IDF**  
✔ **Hyperparameter Optimization** – Uses **Grid Search CV** for best model performance  
✔ **Robust Performance Evaluation** – Precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
✔ **Real-World Applications** – Sentiment analysis in **chatbots, social media analytics**, and more  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled textual data categorized into the following emotions:  
- **Neutral 😐** – Balanced or indifferent expressions  
- **Joy 😊** – Happiness, excitement, or enthusiasm  
- **Sadness 😢** – Expressions of sorrow or grief  
- **Fear 😨** – Anxious or alarming sentiments  
- **Surprise 😲** – Unexpected or shocking reactions  
- **Anger 😠** – Frustration, annoyance, or resentment  
- **Shame 😔** – Embarrassment, guilt, or regret  
- **Disgust 🤢** – Repulsion, aversion, or strong disapproval  

## ⚙️ Model Training Process  
The classification pipeline follows these steps:  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and transforming raw text for efficient processing  
2️⃣ **Feature Extraction** – Converting text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**  
3️⃣ **Model Training** – Applying **Grid Search CV** for hyperparameter optimization  
4️⃣ **Evaluation** – Assessing performance using standard machine learning metrics  

## 📊 Performance Metrics  
The model is evaluated using:  
🔹 **Confusion Matrix** – Visual representation of classification accuracy  
🔹 **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** – Essential metrics for model reliability  
🔹 **ROC-AUC Curve** – Measuring binary classification effectiveness
